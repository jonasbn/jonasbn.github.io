# Hello World!

I am jonasbn, computer programmer, runner, LEGO builder, powernapper and father of 2 boys all squeezed in the few hours available.

I have several [Github repositories](https://github.com/jonasbn), which might be of interest or your can check [my blog](https://lastmover.wordpress.com/).

If you want to know more about me, checkout my [about.me page](https://about.me/jonasbn).

If you came here to learn something, please go to my [_today I learned_ repository](http://jonasbn.github.io/til/), much more insightful stuff there.

Take care,

jonasbn
