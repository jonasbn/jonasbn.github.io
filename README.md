# Hello World!

I am jonasbn, computer programmer, runner, LEGO builder, _power napper_ and father of 2 boys all squeezed in the few hours available in the day.

I have several [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/jonasbn), which might be of interest or your can check [my blog on dev.to](https://dev.to/jonasbn) or [my older blog on Wordpress](https://lastmover.wordpress.com/) - or if you prefer short form, check Twitter where I am [@jonasbn](https://twitter.com/jonasbn).

If you want to know more about me, check out [my about.me page](https://about.me/jonasbn) or [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonasbn/).

The most popular presentation I ever did is [available on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/jonasbn/perl-and-jenkins-for-osd2011) and is on the topic of implementing Continuous Integration for Perl using Jenkins. I have done many talks of the years at conferences, workshops and user group meetings, some are even [caught on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1pQllQo7MQ&t=9s&list=PLE3HjmQMwpQQ_UBvLwYxPZ13M9eM5MraZ&index=18)

The most popular Open Source project I have worked on is [Workflow](https://metacpan.org/pod/Workflow) - _Simple, flexible system to implement workflows_ in Perl.

If you came here to learn something, you might be interesting in my [_today I learned_ repository](http://jonasbn.github.io/til/), much more insightful and _random_ stuff there.

Take care,

jonasbn
