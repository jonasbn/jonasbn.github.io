# Hello World!

I am jonasbn, computer programmer, runner, LEGO builder, powernapper and father of 2 boys all squeezed in the few hours available.

If you want to know about be, checkout my [about.me page](https://about.me/jonasbn).

If you came here to learn something, please go to my [_today I learned_ repository](https://github.com/jonasbn/til), much more insightful stuff there.

Take care,
