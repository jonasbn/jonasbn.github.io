# Hello World!

I am jonasbn, I am a:

- computer programmer
- runner
- LEGO builder
- _power napper_
- all squeezed in the few hours available in the day.

I have several [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/jonasbn), which might be of interest or you can check [my blog on dev.to](https://dev.to/jonasbn) or [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonasbn/).

The most popular presentation I ever did is [available on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/jonasbn/perl-and-jenkins-for-osd2011) and is on the topic of implementing Continuous Integration for Perl using Jenkins. I have done many talks over the years at conferences, workshops and user group meetings, some were even [caught on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1pQllQo7MQ&t=9s&list=PLE3HjmQMwpQQ_UBvLwYxPZ13M9eM5MraZ&index=18)

Some of the most popular Open Source projects I have worked on are:

- [Workflow](https://metacpan.org/pod/Workflow) - _Simple, flexible system to implement workflows_ in Perl
- [GitHub Spellcheck Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-spellcheck-action) - _A GitHub Action for spellchecking your Markdown, Python and Text files_

If you came here to learn something, you might find my [_today I learned_ repository](http://jonasbn.github.io/til/), more interesting.

Take care,

jonasbn
