# Hello World!

I am jonasbn, computer programmer, runner, LEGO builder, powernapper and father of 2 boys all squeezed in the few hours available in the day.

I have several [Github repositories](https://github.com/jonasbn), which might be of interest or your can check [my blog](https://lastmover.wordpress.com/).

If you want to know more about me, check out my [about.me page](https://about.me/jonasbn).

The most popular presentation I ever did is [available on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/jonasbn/perl-and-jenkins-for-osd2011) and is on the topic of implementing Continous Integration for Perl using Jenkins.

The most popular Open Source project I have worked on is [Workflow](https://metacpan.org/pod/Workflow) - _Simple, flexible system to implement workflows_ in Perl.

If you came here to learn something, you might be interesting in my [_today I learned_ repository](http://jonasbn.github.io/til/), much more insightful stuff there.

Take care,

jonasbn
